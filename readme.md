# Metals Feature Requests

This is the right place to report feature requests for Metals.

The [scalameta/metals issue
tracker](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/issues) is reserved for bug
reports and issues that have an assigned milestone.

The number of 👍 reactions helps us prioritize which features to work on first,
but note that other criteria such as complexity of implementation will also be
taken into account.
